**Participants:** JC Owens, Tanay Choudhary, John Letey

**Description:** Designing a chessboard using Python. The idea is to create a 2-D array of size 8x8. The pieces in a chess game are: 16x Pawns, 4x Rooks, 4x Knights, 4x Bishops, 2x Queens and 2x Kings (Divided in the the colors black and white)

Each of the pieces has been made using a class called Pieces which holds the following characteristics:

- the kind of the piece
- the color of the piece (Either black/white)
- the life which is either 1(default) or 0 (When a piece dies in chess)
  
These pieces were then used to populate the chessboard and now we plan to work on the movement functions. We have also planned to create separate functions for the movement of each of the characters.
